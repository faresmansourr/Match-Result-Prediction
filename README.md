# Match-Result-Prediction
This project aims to compare different models to predict a premier league match winner. This will be done by using different models such as (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Na√Øve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors). By evaluating them, the best model will be used to predict the winning team.
